This is a project being developed entirely for learning purposes following a [Figma UI project](https://www.figma.com/community/file/874600772514053297).

Purposes of this project:

- **Test-driven Development (TDD)**
- Practicing the creation of reusable components.
- Improving my knowledge of some key React Native libraries such as: **@react-navigation/native**.

... and more.
